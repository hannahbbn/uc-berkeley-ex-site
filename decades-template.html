                        Following years of calls from the public to open access to Berkeley’s excellent courses and programs,
University Extension came to life in 1891 when three professors crossed the Bay by ferry to offer
courses in San Francisco in history (Prof. Bacon), mathematics (Prof. Stringham) and English
literature (Prof. Gayley) 2 . These long awaited education opportunities were met with much
enthusiasm by the people of San Francisco, more than 800 people attended the first classes.
However, following the official approval of Extension by the Academic Senate in 1892, a financial
crisis hit the university and in 1893 the faculty was no longer able to provide courses to the public
without being offered any compensation.
